## Product Description

ArenaNet’s MMO still pops off with living world drops, strike missions, and goofy beetle races—yet progress can feel like swimming through goo. This trainer hooks straight into the 64-bit client, rewriting live memory the same way scene tools like UnknownCheats’ 64-bit table and KX Trainer do . One hotkey and you’re sky-swimming over Queensdale or popping directly into Tequatl’s hitbox. A lightweight overlay keeps everything mouse-friendly; no .dat edits or chunky custom clients required.

## Installation Instructions 🚀

1. **Grab** the zipped trainer stash anywhere outside the game folder.
2. **Extract** with your fav archiver.
3. **Whitelist** the exe—memory hooks give antivirus false freak-outs.
4. **Launch** Guild Wars 2, load your character.
5. **Run** the trainer as admin; status line pings “Client Hooked”.
6. Tap **F1**, tick power-ups, melt mobs.
7. Flip **INS** to disable hooks before touching WvW or public raids to keep heat low.

*CE fans:* import the bundled .CT, attach to `Gw2-64.exe`, tick scripts, done.

## Quick FAQ ❓

**Can I get banned?**
No cheat is ghost-proof. This cloak NOPs local checks, but ArenaNet’s server side sees wallet spikes. Stick to PvE or solo instances to fly safest.

**Will patches break stuff?**
Offsets auto-scan at launch, same idea KX Tool uses, so small client updates rarely dent anything. For major patches, dev pushes a hotfix quick.

**Works with shaders and DPS meters?**
Yes. Overlay draws in its own layer; Reshade, ArcDPS, GW2Radial all coexist fine.
